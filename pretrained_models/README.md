We evaluate previous coverage criteria and NLC on the following DNN models.

| Model        | Training dataset | Remark                       |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ResNet50     | CIFAR10          | Image & Discriminative model |
| ResNet50     | ImageNet         | Image & Discriminative model |
| VGG16_bn     | CIFAR10          | Image & Discriminative model |
| VGG16_bn     | ImageNet         | Image & Discriminative model |
| MobileNet_V2 | CIFAR10          | Image & Discriminative model |
| MobileNet_V2 | ImageNet         | Image & Discriminative model |
| BigGAN       | CIFAR10          | Image & Generative model     |
| BigGAN       | ImageNet         | Image & Generative model     |
| LSTM         | IMDB             | Text & Discriminative model  |

Their implementations are shown in `models`.
